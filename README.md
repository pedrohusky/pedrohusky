### Why I do what I do

There's actually no reason, besides my love for code. I never started this to go after money. No.

### Where I live

I live in Brazil, this beautiful but at the sime time, harsh country.

### Donation Info

This part is complicated to me because I don't like to ask for money. No one like. But here is my donation info for anyone who wants to give a little light to this young soul. :)
